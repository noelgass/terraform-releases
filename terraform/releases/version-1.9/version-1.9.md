# Version 1.9

## Introduction

NEW FEATURES:

Input variable validation rules can refer to other objects: Previously input variable validation rules could refer only to the variable being validated. Now they are general expressions, similar to those elsewhere in a module, which can refer to other input variables and to other objects such as data resources.
templatestring function: a new built-in function which is similar to templatefile but designed to render templates obtained dynamically, such as from a data resource result.
